# chatbot
I made this so that I can congraduate my my borher-in-law because I could not attend his wedding.
Instead I thought the chatbot can do it for me. Not a fancy chat bot nor using fancy natural language process library
but it works for keeping up a few conversations.


Basic features
<p>-Give a simple reply to what you thought of the wedding(e.g. good, bad, great, terrible). </p>

<p>-If your device has sound on the bot will have voice over its texts. Depending on your device language setting
 it might sound like a clown.
